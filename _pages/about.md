Background
======
Mr. Xu is currently a Ph.D. candidate, supervised by [Prof. Yiu Siu-Ming](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/smyiu), in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong. Before he came to Hong Kong, he received a B.Eng. degree majoring in information security. 

Research Interests
======
Broadly speaking, I am interested in Applied Cryptography and Data Security. Specifically, my current research focuses on Post-Quantum Cryptography, Searchable Encryption, and Privacy-Preserving in the context of the outsourced data (e.g. cloud storage, EMR).
